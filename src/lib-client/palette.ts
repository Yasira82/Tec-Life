/**
 * The colours this app paints with, as CSS variables.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Life paints almost entirely in inline styles, and it read its colours
 * from `TEC_COLORS` in `@yasser172/tec-ui` — 49 references in `app/page.tsx`
 * alone, and this repo had no theme module at all.
 * Those are plain 6-digit hex strings and they are RIGHT to be: the package's
 * own contract test pins it, because consumers append alpha to them across the
 * fleet. But a hex literal baked into a `style={{}}` cannot follow a theme. It
 * is a value, decided once, at render.
 *
 * That is the entire reason light mode did not exist here. `layout.tsx` has
 * imported `tec-design-tokens.css` from the beginning, and not one component
 * ever read a token out of it. Life had a Settings row labelled "Appearance"
 * and nothing behind it.
 *
 * So the app keeps its inline styles and swaps what it puts IN them: a
 * `var(--tec-*)` reference, resolved by the browser at paint time, against
 * whichever theme block is currently winning. Same shape of code, one word
 * different, and the whole app follows the page.
 *
 * ── The trap this file exists to close ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Fifty places wanted a colour at partial opacity and got it by appending two
 * hex digits to a hex string:
 *
 *     border: `1px solid ${TEC_COLORS.gold}22`
 *
 * Pointing that at a variable produces `var(--tec-gold)22` — invalid CSS that
 * raises NO error anywhere. The declaration is dropped and the border silently
 * stops painting.
 *
 * `goldA()` and `inkA()` below are the answer: the token layer publishes the
 * CHANNELS (`--tec-gold-rgb`, `--tec-text-rgb`) and these wrap them in `rgba()`,
 * so opacity composes with a theme instead of fighting it.
 *
 * Never write `` `${C.gold}33` `` again. `theme.test.ts` fails the build on it —
 * in four different shapes, because each one shipped somewhere first.
